The bot can solve any 2D Maze autonomously, it uses right hand rule algorithm to complete the maze.




## Major Components required for autonomous bot

 - Arduino Uno/Mega 
 - 3 * Ultrasonic Sensor
 - Motors
 - Motor Drivers

## Right hand Algorithm 

The Right hand rule algorithm is used in this bot. 
This algo makes the bot turn right as whenever it has paths in all three directions and the bot turns left only when no other path is available , other than that the bot moves forward . so by using this algo the bot can reach the end without returning to the base. The bot returns to the initial position if and only if there is no end in the maze.
